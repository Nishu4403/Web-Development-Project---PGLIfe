# Web-Development-Project---
PG Life is a Full-Stack Web Application. This is a project that I was assigned to make during my Internshala Full Stack Web Development Internship Training. I got the guidance, and following that I made this web application with my own undertsnading and knowledge. It is customized according to what I thought would be better functionalities in this app, from the user perspective.
This web app is fully responsive. In this WWeb Application you can Sign-ip or login by filling the required credentials which then will be stored in a database. You can add PG's to your interested PG's list and book a PG. 

I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, DBMS, Javascript, React, AJAX and MySQL to make this web app.

This web app has the following functionalities:
1. Home page
2. PG list page
3. PG details page
4. Dashboard
5. Sign-up modal
6. Login modal
7. Navbar
8. Breadcrumb
10. Footer

Entire web app can be surfed without logging in for user's ease and attraction for new users. Only certain features such as dashboard, and marking interested are available upon log in.
